# AE4350_Bio_inspired_2021

The file main.py contains the last version of the code utilized to generate graphs or to test some new ideas.
In the folder TASK1, TASK2 and TASK3 there is the python script (saved as .txt file) to generate all the other files contained in the folder (JSON files containing network
structure description and .h5 file containing the value of the weights and biases of both  RNN and FFNN).


# For in every main.py and main.txt file it is necessary to specify in the code the path where the data-label couple for training are provided. 
Those data are obtained by converting the matrices contained in .mat files into .csv files.
